# Sutton and Barto Implementation

### What?

Implementation of some (or all, idk when I get to that) of the programming exercises (the ones with the graphs) from Sutton and Barto. These comprehensive notebooks are from [Denny Britz's compilation](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/)

- [David Silver's RL Course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)

Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course.
